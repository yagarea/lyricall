## Lyricall as a movement


### 1. Response to the standardized sterility of art
This point comes first because it is the main reason why the Lyricall project was created.

Today's art and creativity in general are dehumanized, sterile, delicately correct, and one-dimensional.
Art is repetitive, unoriginal, and unvaried. The need to truly experiment has disappeared.
Artists and the companies that support them optimize for populism.
This phenomenon is natural in a free market and is not technically wrong.
Authors are simply adapting their offerings to demand.
In our opinion, consumers are responsible for this state of affairs.

Our view can be explained metaphorically by comparing a wax apple and a real apple:  

> Imagine two baskets of apples in front of you. One contains wax apples and the other 
> real apples. Even though the wax apples are beautiful to look at, 
> they have no nutritional value and actually all look the same. They have no taste and no
> smell. They are an artificial product for superficial aesthetic satisfaction.
>
> Real apples are sometimes bruised, battered, maybe even cracked, they don't have a nice color
> or a symmetrical shape. But they are a real and honest product of something alive.
> They have nutritional value. They have a taste that may not be appreciated by everyone, but at least they have a taste 
> that can be responded to. That you can have an opinion about. Each apple is unique and not 
> a product made according to a "proven template."

This point is even more relevant in the age of AI.


### 2. Decentralization
Today, art creation is centralized and monopolized. A small group of companies, and therefore people, have
the power to decide on the success of authors, set limits on correctness, and sometimes even control
censorship. As the authors of this project, we ask who they are to decide
on the cultural development of society and what is good for it.

Freedom of expression is one of the most valuable things a person can have, and as we know from history
(unfortunately in many countries even today), it cannot be taken for granted.
Because art is one of the most important forms of free speech. Its censorship or
moderation of content violates the most fundamental human right, the right to free 
speech. Decentralization helps protect this fundamental right.

The lyricall project should be one of those that initiates decentralization and inspires
others to independent creation.


### 3. Liberation of language and expression
Language serves people, not the other way around. Language is a tool for human expression, and those who use it
hold the reins. Linguistic rules are meant to help people understand how language works
and serve as a guide, not as a tool for bureaucratizing and rigidifying language.
Language should be a living and constantly evolving element.

Even poetry has no superior form. There is no right way to write poetry, even
though in the past many manifestos and documents have been written that have attempted to bind
the forms of its expression. It is okay to express one's opinion, but it is not okay to enforce
its observance. If someone decides to follow a particular direction, it should always
be a voluntary decision by the individual, not a presumption by authority.
